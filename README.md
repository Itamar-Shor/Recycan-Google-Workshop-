# GoogleWorkshop

**Quality of life features:**

* History of recycle bins I have used.
* Click to navigate - open google maps and show directions to a marker
* Night or dark mode for the map


**More Ideas:**

* Points model - users recycle and share on social media and get points and medals.
* Following recycling events (we need to see if there are any).
* Match an item I want to recycle to the correct category.
* Show organizations that collect stuff.
